# Games, Unlimited Games

## Overview
This program was designed in C++ 14. It also utilizes SFML structuring and designing the UI. It is designed to sort
through a user's inputted designations to align them with video games fitting for their standards.

## Qualifications
C++ 14 : Compiler must support C++ 14.
SFML : Must be installed correctly on individual's computer. (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)

# Running the Code
First, the user must clone the repository (https://github.com/nicoanimal/Games-Unlimited-Games/). The user must also
ensure that SFML is correctly installed for ease of running. The user can either build the code using CMAKE or run it
using their preferred compiler.

After running this code through the user's compiler of choice, the user will be prompted with a opening menu and
"continue" button, prompting a user to select a region. Once a region is selected, more prompts will pop up for user
selection to specifically narrow down the user's inputs. The user will then be generated a list of at most 20 games
matching their inputs, along with the time it took for quick sort and merge sort to sort through these games for the
result. Then the user is allowed to exit at any time by hitting the stop button on their compiler. The terminal will
also produce the same displayed output for potentially easier reading.
